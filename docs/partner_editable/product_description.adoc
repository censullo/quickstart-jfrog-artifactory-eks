Once you deploy JFrog’s Artifactory, you can use it as a production service. For further
information about setting up Artifactory, see the <<_get_started_with_jfrog_artifactory,Getting started with Artifactory>> section,
later in this guide.

IMPORTANT: The deployment is configured as “infrastructure as code.” Any changes
to the infrastructure should be done by updating the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacks.html[CloudFormation stack^]. Any
changes performed on the boxes themselves (including reverse-proxy
configurations) are lost when an instance reboots. By design, upon shutdown of an
instance—or when Artifactory is unavailable—an Auto Scaling group replaces the
node, following a load-balancing health check.
