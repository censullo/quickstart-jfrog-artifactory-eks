// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment)*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC,
subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, an Amazon EKS cluster with its supporting infrastructure, an S3 bucket, an Amazon RDS instance. It then deploys
Artifactory via Helm.
* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into an existing VPC*. This option provisions an Amazon EKS cluster, an S3 bucket, an Amazon RDS instance, into your
existing AWS infrastructure. It then deploys Artifactory via Helm.


The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-name} settings, as discussed later in this guide.
