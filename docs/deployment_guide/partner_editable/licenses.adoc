This Quick Start requires an Enterprise or Enterprise+ license for Artifactory. To use the
Quick Start in your production environment, sign up for a free trial license, which includes
three Artifactory Enterprise licenses. Place the license keys in the specified fields when you
launch the Quick Start. Enterprise or Enterprise+ licenses are required due to the following
features of this deployment:

* High availability
* S3 object storage

NOTE: If the license isnâ€™t an Enterprise or Enterprise+ license, the license is invalid,
or the license is not included, the deployment will fail. Also, ensure that the number
of secondary Artifactory servers is at most the amount licensed minus one, for the
primary server. If you specify too many servers, see the <<_faq,FAQ section>> for instructions.

If you use a free trial, ensure that you convert to a permanent license before your trial ends,
otherwise the nodes will become unresponsive. You can request a quote by contacting

There is no cost to use this Quick Start, however you will be billed for the resources deployed. For more information see the http://general-content-file[AWS Quick Start General Content Guide].
